<p>My name is Jacob Rothschild. I'm a mechanical engineer and a recent graduate of Union College in Schenectady, NY. I do my best to avoid being idle and I have a passion for creation which assists me in this regard, whether through music, writing, or various design projects.</p>
<p>My time at Union has focused heavily on mechanical design, providing me opportunities in and out of the classroom to work on design-focused problems. Most recently, I completed my senior project, which consisted of designing and constructing a modular CNC machine that can be configured for many CNC applications such as 3D printing, CNC routing, and laser cutting.</p>
<p>Outside of academic projects, I frequently undertake various personal projects. Recently, partially in preparation for the aforementioned senior project, I spent a summer modifying and improving an older 3D printer. This required that I identify weak design features, draft and model alternative designs using CAD, print those parts, and retrofit them onto the printer. It was a very gratifying experience and I use the upgraded 3D printer on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Clearly, I have an interest in CNC technology, which provides excellent tools for those of us with a passion for creation, but this passion began for me with woodworking. My first large-scale project, which sparked my initial interest in making, was to build a woodworking shop in my parents' basement. Some day soon I hope to find an opportunity to become more familiar with machining as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting my webpage. Please feel free to explore some of my favorite projects, found <a href="/projects.html">here</a>.</p>

  and am eager to become more familiar with machining.


  Growing up in the quiet town of Florham Park, I've always had a project to work on. Throughout middle school, these projects focused on "fixing" my new laptop, exploring my limits of software customization. Often, I "fixed" my laptop until I broke something, at which point my project became fixing the damage I had done. This was largely how I became familiar with IT work.</p>

  a passion for creating. This passion has been fulfilled through music, and writing, but my favorite is to create objects, especially mechanical devices. At the time of writing, I'm soon to be a graduate of Union College in Schenectady, NY.


In both my sophomore and junior years, I had the opportunity to work on various teams to design and build robotic machines meant to accomplish simple tasks. On more than one occasion, mine was the only team to develop a mechanism fully capable of completing the task. My Senior year offered me the opportunity to work on an even larger project, this time on a team of eight. For this, we were asked to design and construct a remote-controlled robot that could play mini- golf against the professor’s young daughter while following the rules of mini-golf, the main challenge being that we had to use the course’s own putters and balls. This project was my personal favorite of those completed for a course. I learned a great deal leading the design team dedicated to developing the driving mechanics, which involved delegating responsibilities, scheduling meetings, and setting deadlines.

Among other extracurricular activities, I currently work at the Union Student Technical Assistance Resource as head student, where I manage a team of other students, creating schedules, assisting students with their technological needs, and working closely with the Union IT department. This position has provided me a great deal of experience interacting with people, often in stressful situations. Having joined the team my freshman year, I was able to quickly grow to a team leader through my efforts to learn more about computer repair and my dedication to the work itself.</p> -->
