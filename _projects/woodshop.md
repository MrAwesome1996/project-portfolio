This space was nearly ready (save for an immense amount of organizing and cleaning) except that it very badly needed a workbench. I set out to build a heavy-duty bench with unique features."

## Overview
In the summer of 2016 I took it upon myself to assemble a suitable space for woodworking in my parents' basement. Plenty of storage was already prepared and simply needed to be organized, but we were missing an essential component - a workbench. This being my first foray into design and construction, I took inspiration from the YouTube creator "The King of Random," who had recently posted a video of his own workbench build. What made his table special was a recessed cutout in the table that allowed the user to insert tools for use as a routing table or a low-precision table saw. This feature is demonstrated in the video below where I swap out a jigsaw table insert for a router.

## Design Process
I began with some research. I first needed to find a technique to keep the table top sturdy and rigid, so that over time the tabletop wouldn't sag, as I've seen happen on other plywood tables. I discovered the concept of a "torsion box," which essentially is a box with an internal frame that prevents flexing or torsion and I elected to build the tabletop using this style of design.

With a basic design ready, I continued with a series of sketches to flesh out the rest of the design. Though immensely helpful, these are unremarkable so I will not include them here. Eventually, I settled on a table of dimensions 5ft L x 4ft W x 3ft H. With this in mind, it was time to sketch out the internal framework for the torsion box. This was to be assembled using 1in x 3in wooden planks as they are readily available, are relatively light, and make the tabletop a comfortable thickness. With dimensioned sketches ready, I wrote up a bill of materials as a shopping list, headed to the local home improvement store, and purchased all the wood I needed. This included:

1. The table surface
* 1 4ft x 8ft sheet of 3/4in baltic birch plywood (cut down to 4ft x 5ft and excess)
2. The table bottom
* 1 4ft x 8ft sheet of 1/4in inexpensive plywood (cut down to 4ft x 5ft and excess)
3. An under-table shelf
* 1 4ft x 8ft sheet of 3/4in particle board
4. Internal structure and support for the shelf
* 10 8ft lengths of 1in x 3in planks

Finally, I drew out a dimensioned sketch of all the parts I needed to make, noting how much was required of each. This made it very easy to keep track of my progress and next steps. Now I was ready to get started.

## Construction
The plywood for the table top surface and bottom were already cut at the store. Using a circular saw, I measured, marked, and cut the 1in x 3in planks. I glued the walls of the "torsion box" tabletop to the bottom of the birch plywood panel, and reinforced this glue-up with brad nails. I then began to build up the inner framework using a similar technique. I dry fit each segment to ensure that I hadn't made a mistake, applied glue, put the segment in place, and reinforced it with brad nails. The completed framework can be seen in the photo below. I cut down some scrap pieces and created sockets for the 3in x 3in legs I intended to use, seen installed for a test fit in the picture below.

With this inner framework completed, I used a hand plane to level out any high spots or strange warps in the 1in x 3in planks. The plywood inside one square of the framework needed to be cut out to allow for the tool insert feature, so I drilled holes through the plywood in the corners of the square to provide clearance for a jigsaw. Then I glued on the bottom panel, which can be seen in the photo below. I then used a jigsaw to roughly cut out the square in the top and the bottom of the table, and used a router to cut the material flush with the square in the inner frame. Finally, I set the router to a cutting depth equal to the thickness of a plexiglas panel, and carved a square channel around the hole, leaving a lip for the plexiglas square to rest in (I hope to have a closeup of this soon). I prepared a router, a jigsaw, and a circular saw with a plexiglas front panel, allowing me to insert each into the recess in the table, and providing functionality similar to a routing table, a scroll saw, and a table saw.

The final touch was to add a shelf under the table for storage. 1in x 3in planks were screwed to the substantial legs of the table as supports for the particle board. I measured the outside distances between each leg, and, using a circular saw, a yard stick, and some clamps, cut the particle board to size using the yard stick as a guide to keep the cut straight. I cut clearances for the table legs and, finally, installed the shelf (I hope to have a photo including this soon as well).
